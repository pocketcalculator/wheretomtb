# WhereToMTB

WhereToMTB connects mountain bikers with the closest, rideable trails.  Submit a city name, address, GPS coordinates or a zip code, preferred trail length and a search radius and WhereToMTB will deliver trail locations as markers on Google Maps with a summary, current weather conditions, precipitation data and a ride/avoid recommendation.  It utilizes APIs from Google Maps, Accuweather and MTB Project.

WhereToMTB was written with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery.
